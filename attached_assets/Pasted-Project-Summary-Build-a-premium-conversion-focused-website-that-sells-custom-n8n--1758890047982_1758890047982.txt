Project Summary
---------------
Build a premium, conversion-focused website that sells custom n8n automation creation services. The website must look modern, minimal, and highly polished with rich micro-interactions and animations. All on-site copy, labels, headings, and user-facing content must be in **Georgian (ქართული)**, **except** the order form fields and placeholders — those must be in **English only**. **There must be no pricing page** anywhere on the site.

Primary goals:
- Convert visitors into qualified project requests via a single, best-in-class Order experience (multi-step, animated, context-aware).
- Communicate trust, expertise, and quality through design, microcopy (Georgian), and sample case visuals.
- Provide an admin backend to manage incoming requests and connect them to Slack/Email/n8n where needed.

Target audience
---------------
Small-to-medium business owners, marketing managers, customer support leads, and technical teams in Georgia who want bespoke automation (n8n workflows) built for their operations.

Brand / Visual Guidelines
-------------------------
- Tone: professional, confident, approachable.
- Georgian fonts: primary: **FiraGO** or **BPG Nino Mtavruli** (for headings). Body: **BPG Arial** or FiraGO Regular. Provide webfont setup and fallbacks.
- Color palette:
  - Primary: deep blue / tech-indigo (for CTAs and accents)
  - Secondary: soft violet / cyan gradient for highlights
  - Neutral: off-white background (#FBFBFD), graphite text
  - Accents: subtle neon for micro-animations (sparingly)
- Spacing: generous whitespace, large hero, 8–10px baseline grid.
- Shape language: rounded corners (8–16px), soft shadows, glass-card elements.
- Micro-animations: hover lifts, ghost glows, subtle parallax, SVG path animations.
- Use Lottie JSON animations for complex micro-interactions and Framer Motion for component transitions. Provide fallback SVG/CSS animations.

Must-have Constraints
---------------------
1. **All labels, headings, descriptions, CTAs and visible content must be Georgian.** (Provide Georgian strings below.)
2. **Order form page and its form field labels/placeholders must be English only.**
3. **No pricing page anywhere.** Never show prices or tiers. Use language like “Request a quote” (in Georgian) or “Submit request” (in English for form button).
4. SEO-friendly server-rendered Next.js (or SSR-capable React) app.
5. Responsive (desktop/tablet/mobile) with mobile-first animations gracefully toned down on older devices.

Top-level Pages & Detailed Requirements
--------------------------------------

1) Home Page (მთავარი)
   - Hero:
     - Full-bleed, modern hero with animated background (SVG workflow lines + subtle node pulses).
     - Georgian hero headline: use provided Georgian copy (see Appendix).
     - Subheading (Georgian) that explains the value in 1–2 lines.
     - Primary CTA (Georgian): “შეუკვეთე ახლა” — scrolls or opens the Order page modal.
     - Secondary CTA (Georgian): “ნახე სერვისები” — anchors to Services.
     - Visual: Animated Lottie or an SVG “flowchart” that animates when hero comes into view.
   - Why-us strip:
     - 3–4 animated benefit cards (Georgian title + short Georgian sentence). Cards should lift and show micro-animation on hover.
     - Icons: custom line icons that animate (draw-in) on view.
   - How it works (Georgian):
     - 3-step horizontal timeline (Discover → Build → Deliver) with animated connectors and small Lottie illustrations.
   - Featured case snippet / carousel:
     - small project snapshots with short Georgian captions and hover-to-expand preview. Each item opens modal with more details (Georgian).
   - Testimonials (Georgian) with avatar carousel.
   - CTA strip (Georgian) — repeated “შეუკვეთე ახლა”.

2) Services Page (სერვისები)
   - Grid of service cards (4–8 items).
   - Each card contains:
     - Georgian title, 1–2-line Georgian description.
     - Small animated icon (Lottie or SVG).
     - “გაიგე მეტი” button (Georgian) that opens a service details modal (all content Georgian).
   - Hover effect: lift + neon edge + soft shadow.
   - Filtering: allow visitors to filter by category (e.g., Messaging, CRM, Data Sync, Email Automation) — labels in Georgian.

3) Order Page (შეკვეთა) — **THE FOCUS** (design as a full-screen interactive experience)
   - This must be the most advanced page. Build it as a **multi-step wizard** (single-page application with animated transitions between steps).
   - Visual context: interactive animated background that visually responds to the user’s choices: a node graph grows/changes as they select integrations (e.g., choose "WhatsApp" and a WhatsApp node appears).
   - Desktop layout: centered card (max-width 880px) with blurred glass background over animated SVG. Mobile: full-width stacked.

   Order flow (ENGLISH labels & placeholders only — the visible success confirmation and non-form copy are Georgian)
   -----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   Step 0: Intro (Georgian headline + subtext) with CTA "Start order" (Georgian).
   Step 1: Project basics (FORM FIELDS — English)
     - Full Name (input) — placeholder "Full name"
     - Email Address (input) — placeholder "Email address"
     - Company Name (optional) — placeholder "Company (optional)"
     - Project Name — placeholder "Project name"
     - Buttons: Next / Back (English)
     - Live validation: inline, accessible, keyboard-friendly.
   Step 2: Select Automation Type (FORM UI — English)
     - Dropdown: Type of Automation (options in English: "WhatsApp/Messenger chatbot", "CRM integration", "Email automation", "File sync / ETL", "Custom workflow - explain")
     - When user selects, show a short contextual help tooltip (Georgian) describing what that automation typically includes.
     - If "Custom" chosen, show a required English textarea: "Short Project Description" (placeholder).
   Step 3: Integrations & data (FORM UI — English + dynamic)
     - Multi-select list of integrations in English (e.g., "Google Sheets", "Airtable", "HubSpot", "Stripe", "Meta/WhatsApp", "Telegram", "Google Drive", "Dropbox", "MySQL", "Postgres", "Webhook")
     - For each chosen integration, show a small animated icon and a conditional mini-question in English: "Do you have API keys or credentials?" (Yes/No)
       - If Yes → show a secure way to attach credentials (file upload, or later securely via encrypted link). Do NOT send credentials by email in plain text.
     - Option to schedule a free discovery call (Georgian label with time-picker UI).
   Step 4: Attach files & examples (FORM UI — English)
     - Drag-and-drop uploads (accept CSV, JSON, PNG, PDF). Show preview thumbnails and file size limits.
     - Optional link field (English) — "Link to example data / docs"
   Step 5: Timeline & priority (FORM UI — English)
     - Radio or slider for delivery speed (e.g., "Standard — 7–14 days", "Fast — 3–5 days") — DO NOT show prices. Show estimated delivery in days only if needed.
     - Priority notes (English textarea).
   Step 6: Review (ENGLISH)
     - Animated order summary card (reads back all English form answers) with nice transitions.
     - Button: "Submit request" (ENGLISH - final submit)
   On Submit:
     - UX: replace wizard with a full-screen success state that animates a node closing or confetti + a Lottie checkmark. Show the success message in Georgian: **"შეკვეთა წარმატებით გაიგზავნა! ჩვენ მალე დაგიკავშირდებით."**
     - Send: save order to DB, send email (Georgian and English short confirmation), notify Slack channel, optionally create a record in Airtable / Google Sheets.
     - Provide shareable Order ID (ex: ORD-2025-0001).
     - Offer button (Georgian) to "გათვალიერება ჩემი შეკვეთის სტატუსი" — opens a simple public-status page for that order ID (token-protected).

   Extra order UX details:
   - Animated progress bar (framer motion) that morphs as user moves through steps.
   - Microcopy tooltips in Georgian that appear inline to explain technical terms.
   - Autosave: persist partial entries in localStorage and allow users to resume.
   - Validation: client-side + server-side with clear localization.
   - Accessibility: all fields labeled, focus outlines, ARIA-live for success messages.
   - Security: file uploads are scanned and sanitized on the backend; credentials must never be emailed; provide secure instructions for handing credentials to the team.

4) About Page (ჩვენ შესახებ)
   - Georgian company story, mission, and team bios (Georgian).
   - Timeline of milestones (animated horizontal timeline).
   - Team cards with hover motion (Georgian names + roles).
   - Section: "How we build automation" — an illustrated workflow in Georgian.

5) Contact Page (კონტაქტი)
   - Georgian contact details and working hours.
   - Embedded Google Map (Georgian address).
   - Quick chat button: opens WhatsApp or Messenger (Georgian label).
   - No contact form here (explicit).

6) Case Studies / Portfolio (კაზუსები)
   - Each caseStudy page in Georgian: problem, solution, impact (metrics — if available), and screenshots or GIFs of workflows.
   - Animated before/after state visualizations.

7) Admin Area (private, secure)
   - Simple admin dashboard to view orders (list, filter by status, search by Order ID or email).
   - Order detail panel with all uploaded files, comments, and ability to change status (New → In Review → In Progress → Delivered → Closed).
   - Buttons to trigger Slack/email notifications, export order to CSV, create n8n job (webhook) to kick off internal onboarding.
   - Protected via SSO or password; store credentials in environment variables.

Global Components & UI Patterns
-------------------------------
- Header: Georgian nav (მთავარი, სერვისები, შეკვეთა, ჩვენ შესახებ, კონტაქტი) — sticky with animated underline on hover.
- Footer: Georgian copyright & social icons.
- Modal system with focus trap and accessible close.
- Reusable Card, Chip, Badge, and Icon components implemented with Tailwind + shadcn/ui.
- Use React Hook Form + Zod for validation; show errors in Georgian for site text and in English for form field-level tooltips where fields are English.

Animations & Motion Strategy
----------------------------
- Use **Framer Motion** for component transitions and micro-interactions.
- Use **Lottie** for complex SVG animations (workflow animations, hero visuals, success states).
- Use animated SVG backgrounds that react to mouse position subtly.
- Performance: disable heavy animations on reduced-motion user setting and on low-power devices.
- CPU-friendly: limit anim frequency, prefer CSS transforms (translate, scale, opacity) and GPU-accelerated properties.

Technical Stack & Implementation Notes
--------------------------------------
- Recommended stack: **Next.js (13/14) with app/router)** OR React with SSR. Use TypeScript.
- Styling: **TailwindCSS** + shadcn/ui primitives. Keep tailwind.config set to load Georgian webfonts.
- Animations: **Framer Motion**, Lottie (react-lottie-player).
- Forms: React Hook Form + Zod.
- DB / Storage: **Supabase** or **Postgres + Prisma** for orders and file metadata; file uploads to S3 / Supabase storage.
- Notifications: SendGrid (email) + Slack webhook. Environment variables must be used for keys (SENDGRID_API_KEY, SLACK_WEBHOOK_URL, DATABASE_URL).
- Optional quick setup: Airtable for minimal MVP (orders collected into Airtable view).
- Deploy: Vercel recommended; ensure environment variables set; use CDN for images & Lottie JSON.
- Analytics: Google Analytics or Plausible + consent modal (Georgian privacy consent).

Security & Privacy
------------------
- HTTPS enforced.
- Input sanitization & size limits for uploads.
- Rate limiting on order endpoint.
- GDPR-like privacy notice (Georgian) and privacy policy page (Georgian).
- Never store API credentials in plaintext; optionally support encrypted secrets and temporary credential upload instructions.

SEO & Performance
-----------------
- Server-side rendered meta tags in Georgian (title, description).
- Social previews (OG tags) include Georgian text.
- Structured data (JSON-LD) for Organization and WebSite schema.
- Lighthouse performance target: >90 mobile & desktop.
- Use image optimization and LQIP placeholders for key visuals.

Deliverables
------------
1. Production-ready Next.js repository with documented README for setup and deployment.
2. Figma design file or equivalent with all screens and components (desktop & mobile).
3. Deployed site on Vercel (or provided deployment instructions).
4. Admin dashboard accessible to project managers.
5. Documentation for handoff: how to change Georgian copy, update animations, and manage orders.
